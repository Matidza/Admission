🚀 Getting Started

Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:

Python 3.8+
Django 4.x
PostgreSQL (or another database of your choice)
Virtualenv (recommended for setting up a virtual environment)
Installation Steps
Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/admissions.git
cd admissions
Create a Virtual Environment (optional but recommended)

bash
Copy code
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use env\Scripts\activate
Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set Up PostgreSQL Database

Create a new PostgreSQL database and user. Then, update the database credentials in settings.py:

python
Copy code
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
        'NAME': 'your_db_name',
        'USER': 'your_username',
        'PASSWORD': 'your_password',
        'HOST': 'localhost',
        'PORT': '5432',
    }
}
Run Migrations

Set up the database schema:

bash
Copy code
python manage.py migrate
Create a Superuser (optional, for admin access)

Create a superuser to access the admin panel:

bash
Copy code
python manage.py createsuperuser
Start the Development Server

Run the development server:

bash
Copy code
python manage.py runserver
Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/ in your browser to access the website.

🔗 Integrating Email Notifications

To send email notifications (for example, when the application status changes), configure email settings in settings.py with your email service provider credentials (e.g., Gmail, SendGrid, etc.).

For Gmail, add the following to settings.py:

python
Copy code
EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend'
EMAIL_HOST = 'smtp.gmail.com'
EMAIL_PORT = 587
EMAIL_USE_TLS = True
EMAIL_HOST_USER = 'your-email@gmail.com'
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = 'your-email-password'
You can then use Django's send_mail function to send application status updates.
