Here is a **System Design Architecture** for your Django-based **School Admission System**. The architecture will cover the high-level components, database schema, and flow of data between different parts of the system.

---

## **High-Level System Architecture**

### **1. Overview**
The system is built using the **Django MVC architecture** (Model-View-Controller) with a PostgreSQL database, providing separate functionality for **parents**, **schools**, and **administrators**.

### **2. Architecture Diagram**

```
[Frontend] <--> [Django Backend] <--> [Database]
   |
   ├── Parents App     → Parent authentication and application submission
   ├── Schools App     → School registration and profile personalization
   ├── Admission App   → Application management and status updates
   └── Admin Dashboard → Centralized review and control
```

---

### **3. System Components**

#### **Frontend**
- **Technology**: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap (for responsive design), and Django Templates.
- **Responsibilities**:
   - Parent registration, login, and application form submission.
   - School registration and dashboard for managing profiles.
   - Real-time updates of admission statuses.
   - Responsive design for mobile compatibility.

#### **Backend (Django)**
- **Technology**: Django Framework (MVC/MVT architecture)
- **Core Apps**:
   1. **Parent App**:
      - User registration and authentication (via Django’s `auth` system).
      - Dashboard to submit applications and track their status.
   2. **Schools App**:
      - School registration and login.
      - Profile personalization (e.g., upload logos, contact information, admission criteria).
   3. **Admission App**:
      - Models for storing and managing admission applications.
      - Views and APIs for parents to submit applications and schools to review them.
      - Status management: Pending, Approved, Rejected.
   4. **Admin Dashboard**:
      - Review all applications and manage global configurations.
- **Other Features**:
   - Email notifications (using SMTP or third-party providers like SendGrid).
   - Middleware for authentication and permissions.

#### **Database**
- **Technology**: PostgreSQL
- **Schema**:
   - **Parent Table**: Stores parent user information.
   - **School Table**: Stores school details.
   - **AdmissionApplication Table**: Tracks submitted applications, statuses, and relationships.
   - **Document Table**: Manages uploaded documents for applications.

| password_hash | VARCHAR(255)  | Not Null                 |

| parent_id     | UUID          | Foreign Key → Parent Table        |
| school_id     | UUID          | Foreign Key → School Table        |
| child_name    | VARCHAR(50)   | Not Null                          |
| grade_level   | VARCHAR(20)   | Not Null                          |
| status        | VARCHAR(20)   | Default: "Pending" (enum)         |
| submitted_at  | TIMESTAMP     | Default: now()                    |

### **4. Document Table**
| Column         | Type          | Constraints                        |
|----------------|---------------|------------------------------------|
| id            | UUID          | Primary Key                        |

## **Data Flow Design**

1. **Parent Workflow**:
   - Parents register or log in to the system.
   - They submit an admission application, including details like the child’s name and grade level.
   - Parents upload supporting documents.
   - The application is saved to the `AdmissionApplication` table with a `Pending` status.
   - Parents receive email confirmation.

2. **School Workflow**:
   - Schools register and log in to their dashboard.
   - They can view a list of all admission applications filtered by status.
   - Schools can **Accept** or **Reject** applications.  
   - Status updates are reflected in real time for parents and recorded in the database.

3. **Admin Workflow**:
   - Admin users can access a dashboard to view all schools and applications.
   - Admins have the ability to override school decisions if needed.

4. **Notifications**:
   - When the status of an application changes, an email is sent to the parent.
   - The email contains the new status and any additional instructions.

| `/api/applications/`     | POST   | Submit a new application (parent).  |
| `/api/applications/<id>` | PATCH  | Update application status (school). |
| `/api/documents/`        | POST   | Upload supporting documents.        |

---

## **Deployment Pipeline**

- **Development**: Local environment using SQLite.
- **Staging**: Use PostgreSQL with testing tools.
- **Production**: Deploy using **Gunicorn** and **Nginx** on cloud servers (Heroku, AWS, etc.).

---

## **Future Enhancements**

- Real-time notifications using **WebSockets**.
- Multi-language support for the user interface.
- Advanced search and filtering for schools.
- Integration with cloud storage (Amazon S3) for document uploads.

This architecture ensures a clean, scalable design while supporting both parents and schools with clear workflows. If you'd like to visualize this with a **diagram** (ERD or flowchart), let me know! I can generate one for you.
